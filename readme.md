A slightly useful website, showing a good number of newspapers in Malaysia with an online presence (with their links, of course).

Though the site can easily be done with HTML and CSS, it's JavaScript based, because it's meant to demonstrate reading and using JSON data from JavaScript. (The boxes and sections are programmatically generated.)

![Full screen capture of the website. Newspaper websites are shown in boxes, containing an icon, name with link, and office location. They are organised in a vertical list of language sections, and at the page top is "Senarai Akhbar Malaysia", in large green type.](screenshot.png)
